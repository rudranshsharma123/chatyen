## Inspiration

We were inspired to create Chatyen because we noticed that there was a lack of decentralized marketplaces for buying and selling chatbots. We wanted to create a platform that would empower individuals to monetize their own chatbots and also provide a space for users to discover and purchase chatbots for their own needs.

## What it does

Chatyen is a decentralized marketplace where users can buy and sell their own chatbots. It also features a few of our own chatbots that users can purchase. The platform is built on blockchain technology, which ensures that all transactions are secure and transparent. Users can browse chatbots, view their features and prices, and make purchases using cryptocurrency.

## How we built it

We built Chatyen using a variety of technologies. The platform is built on Ethereum blockchain using Solidity smart contracts. We used React for the front-end and Truffle for development, testing and deployment of the smart contracts. We also utilized the MetaMask browser extension for interacting with the blockchain.

## Challenges we ran into

One of the main challenges we faced was designing a user-friendly interface for buying and selling chatbots. We had to ensure that users could easily browse and filter chatbots by their features, as well as securely purchase them using cryptocurrency. Additionally, integrating the blockchain technology with the platform was a complex task that required careful consideration and planning.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're proud of creating a decentralized marketplace that enables individuals to monetize their own chatbots. We're also proud of developing a platform that utilizes blockchain technology, which ensures that all transactions are secure and transparent.

## What we learned

Throughout the development of Chatyen, we learned a lot about blockchain technology and its potential applications in the marketplace. We also gained experience in designing user-friendly interfaces for decentralized applications.

## What's next for Chatyen

In the future, we plan to expand the range of chatbots available on the platform, as well as improve the user experience through additional features and enhancements. We also plan to integrate additional blockchain technologies to further increase the security and transparency of the platform.
